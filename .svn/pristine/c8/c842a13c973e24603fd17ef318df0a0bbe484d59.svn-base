WP LinkedIn Auto Publish automatically publishes blog posts to your LinkedIn profile or company page.

== Description ==

WP LinkedIn Auto Publish lets you publish posts automatically from WordPress to your personal LinkedIn profile or to a LinkedIn company page that you are an administrator of. 

The plugin is simple, lightweight and free. It does have a couple of options which includes choosing who you want to share your LinkedIn posts with and whether you want to enable simple text-based sharing or more advanced sharing where you can tell LinkedIn to use your posts feature image. You can also setup a default share message format for all your posts which you can over-ride on the post settings. You can also filter items to be published based on categories selected on the plugin settings page. 

Every post will automatically be published to LinkedIn, however on each post there is a checkbox which enables you to not share a particular post. On a post page and on the all posts page you will also see a record of instances a post has been shared to LinkedIn.
